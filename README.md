# Measured Life Meets Rails Tutorial - Fourth Edition

I am learning Rails 5 [as part of my Measured Life Project](http://measured.life/professional/rails-5/i-will-learn-ruby-on-rails-by-new-years-eve-2017/). 

Visit [measured.life](http://measured.life) to learn more about what I'm working on in general. 

TL,DR -  I'm challenging myself with measuralbe goals to see if meeting such metrics will add more meaning to my life. In general, I'm focusing on health, finance, relationships and professional development. This repository will mark my progress towards my professional goal of learning Ruby on Rails 5 via Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org) by December 31, 2017.

## Rail Tutorial Projects

The crux of the learning via Rails Tutorial is accomplished through completion of the three applications: hello_app, toy_app, and sample_app.

I've created three orphan branches to hold in the repo for each seperate project. To access each individual project, you can either use the pull down branch tab or follow the links below.

[Hello App](https://github.com/storycoder/ML_Rails_Tutorial/tree/hello_app)
[Toy App](https://github.com/storycoder/ML_Rails_Tutorial/tree/toy_app)
[Sample App](https://github.com/storycoder/ML_Rails_Tutorial/tree/sample_app)
