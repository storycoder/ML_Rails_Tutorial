I am learning Rails 5 as part of my Measured Life Project. 

Visit [measured.life](http://measured.life) to learn more about what I'm working on in general. 

TL,DR -  I'm challenging myself with measuralbe goals to see if meeting such metrics will add more meaning to my life. In general, I'm focusing on health, finance, relationships and professional development. This repository will mark my progress towards my professional goal of learning Ruby on Rails 5 via Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org) by December 31, 2017.
